            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Noah Petzinger. I am currently a Computer Science student and part-time research assistant at Fordham University in New York. My research focuses on robotics,
            primarily dealing with a navigation technique called visual homing: a low-cost, efficient method which does not rely on gps. Our current research project involves developing 
            software to implement visual homing both in a simulated environment and in real life using Turtlebot T3 robots. In addition to research other areas of interest for me include
            data science, software development, and game design. I am currently looking for a summer internship in any computer science-related field so please feel free to reach out to me
            via email or social media.
            </p>

                <h3>Google Webpage</h3>
                <p>This project involved essentially reverse-engineering the Google homepage to create a very simple copy of it. The purpose of this project wsa to get some experience with HTML 
                and CSS, as well as familiarize myself with devtools.

                <h3>Housing Price Predictor</h3>
                <p>This project uses the Keras API and data on Iowa housing prices to create a linear regression model used to predict the price of future homes. This project was used to 
                   practice python and to get experience using a popular machine learning API.
